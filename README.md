A drone with suitable sensor technology on board that could monitor the water quality of surface waters so that hazards can be detected in time.

## Proposal Reasoning
Due to industrial and environmental influences as well as the
advancing climate change, it is becoming increasingly important to
determine and monitor the water quality of surface. An advantage
compared to a self-contained watercraft would be that a drone
could independently cover distances over land to get to another
body of water or river branch.

## Innovative Aspects to be Valued
- Measure parameters of pH, dissolved oxygen and temperature
directly on site, without sampling.
- A timestamp as well as a GPS marker for each measurement is
useful.
- Able of water landing and have a minimum flight time of at
least 15 minutes per battery set, the distance of the remote
control should be at least 200 m. The data should be
transmitted directly live to an evaluation unit in a freely
convertible format and stored.
